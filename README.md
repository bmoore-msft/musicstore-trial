This is a sample app for trying out the capabilities of Azure Application Insights and Snapshot Debugging.  The original app can be found [here](http://mvcmusicstore.codeplex.com/).  This app has been slightly modified to help show some of the features in Azure Diagnostics (e.g. added some exceptions to trigger the snapshot debugger) and there's more detail on that below.

If you want to try the sample yourself and see the diagnostics data do the following:

- clone
- open
- build (this will restore the nuget packages)
- deploy environment
- publish
- deploy web test
- enjoy

(I'm going to add more detail than that...)
